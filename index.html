<h3><b> About Fruits</b> </h3>
<!-- this website is about fruits -->
<p>fruit, In its strict botanical sense, the fleshy or dry ripened ovary (enlarged portion of the pistil) 
    of a flowering plant, enclosing the seed or seeds. Apricots, bananas, grapes, bean pods, corn grains, 
    tomatoes, cucumbers, and acorns are all technically fruits. Popularly, the term is restricted to the 
    ripened ovaries that are sweet and either succulent or pulpy. The principal botanical purpose of the 
    fruit is to protect and spread the seed. There are two broad categories of fruit: fleshy and dry. 
    Fleshy fruits include berries, such as tomatoes, oranges, and blueberries, which consist entirely of 
    succulent tissue; single-seeded drupes, including cherries and plums; aggregate fruits, including 
    blackberries and raspberries, which form from a single flower with many pistils, each of which develops 
    into fruitlets; and multiple fruits, such as pineapples and mulberries, which develop from the mature 
    ovaries of an entire inflorescence. Dry fruits include the legumes, cereal grains, capsules, and nuts. 
    Culinary fruits are important sources of dietary fiber and vitamins (especially vitamin C). They can 
    be eaten fresh; processed into juices, jams, and jellies; or preserved by dehydration, canning, 
    fermentation, and pickling.</p>

<p>Karnataka state implements several schemes for the benefit of farmers. Farmers undertake different agriculture and agriculture related activities like 
    growing Agriculture crops, Horticulture crops, Sericulture, Dairy, Poultry, Fishery etc. Each of this activity requires specialised knowledge and 
    experience. Therefore, the state has established specialised and specific department to assist farmers in carrying out farming activities effectively and 
    efficiently. While establishment of exclusive departments brings focused approach for development of each of these activities, farmers need to approach 
    different departments for availing any type of assistance and benefits. It is common practice that all the departments seek documents from the farmers 
    for providing benefits under any scheme. Farmers end up submitting same set of documents to different departments every year. Sometimes they will be 
    required to submit one set of documents for every scheme in same department.</p>

<p id="B"  ><i>A well organized and scrutinized farmer database will avoid farmers from running pillar to post for availing benefits. Besides it would helps the departments in overcoming the aforesaid issues. DPAR e Governance department in association with NIC has developed a software application called Farmer Registration &Unified Beneficiary Information System â€“ FRUITS.</i></p>

<h3><b> Types Of Fruits </b></h3>

<ol div class="C">
    <li> Simple</li>

    <li> Aggregate</li>

    <li> Composite</li>
</ol>

<h4>Simple Fruit</h4>
<p>These fruits develop from the monocarpellary ovary or multicarpellary syncarpous ovary. Only one fruit is formed by the gynoecium. Simple fruits are of two types</p>
<ul div class="C">
    <li><b>Fleshy Fruits:</b> In fleshy fruits, the fruit wall is differentiated into epicarp, mesocarp, and endocarp. These fruits develop from superior or inferior syncarpous gynoecium.</li>
    <li><b>Dry Fruits:</b> The pericarp of simple dry fruits is usually quite dry and hard. It is not differentiated into the three layers of epicarp, mesocarp and endocarp. In some dry fruits, this pericarp is broken down and the seeds are scattered or dispersed. These fruits are dehiscent fruits.</li>
</ul>
<img class="A" width="500" height="300" src="fruits1.jpg">

<h4>Aggregate Fruit</h4>
<P>These are the fruits that develop from the multicarpellary apocarpous ovary. It becomes a fruitlet because each carpel is separated from one another in the apocarpous ovary. These fruits make a bunch of fruitlets which is known as etaerio.</P>
<ul div class="C">
    <li>Etaerio of follicles</li>
    <li>Etaerio of achenes</li>
    <li>Etaerio of berries</li>
    <li>Etaerio of drupes</li>
</ul>
<img width="300" height="300" src="aggregate.png">

<h4>Composite Fruit</h4>
<p>All composite fruits are false fruits. In these fruits, generally, there are many ovaries and other floral parts combining to form the fruit. These are of two types:</p>
<ul div class="C">
    <li><b>Sorosis:</b> These fruits develop from spike, spadix or catkin inflorescence. Examples inJackfruit fruit, Kevda (screwpine). In jackfruit (Kathal) pistillate flowers are developed around the peduncle. In fruit formation, the pericarp becomes spongy and fused.</li>
    <li><b>Sycosis:</b> These fruits develop from hypanthodium inflorescence. Receptacle becomes hollow and has a pore. Numerous small scales surround the pore. Eg. Ficus species Peepal</li>
</ul>


<ul div class="C">
    <li>Depending on how fruits are formed, fruits can be classified into three main categories:</li>
</ul>
<table id="D">
    <tr>
        <th>True Fruits</th>
        <th>False Fruits</th>
        <th>Parthenocarpic Fruits</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Develops from a mature superior ovary.</td>
        <td>Develops from parts of the flower other than the ovary.</td>
        <td>Fruits develop without fertilisation of the egg cell.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Eg: Peas, Grapes, Mango, Coconut</td>
        <td>Eg : In apple and pear the fleshy edible part of the fruit
             develops from the swollen thalamus.</td>
        <td>Eg: seedless varieties of banana, watermelon and grapes.</td>
    </tr>
